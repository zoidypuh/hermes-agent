# Web Search & Extract

Hermes Agent includes two model-callable web tools backed by multiple providers:

- **`web_search`** — search the web and return ranked results
- **`web_extract`** — fetch and extract readable content from one or more URLs (with built-in deep-crawl support when the backend provides it)

Both are configured through a single backend selection. Providers are chosen via `hermes tools` or set directly in `config.yaml`. Recursive crawling capabilities (Firecrawl/Tavily) are exposed through `web_extract` rather than as a separate `web_crawl` tool.

## Backends

| Provider | Env Var | Search | Extract | Crawl | Free tier |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Firecrawl** (default) | `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | 500 credits/mo |
| **SearXNG** | `SEARXNG_URL` | ✔ | — | — | ✔ Free (self-hosted) |
| **Tavily** | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | 1 000 searches/mo |
| **Exa** | `EXA_API_KEY` | ✔ | ✔ | — | 1 000 searches/mo |
| **Parallel** | `PARALLEL_API_KEY` | ✔ | ✔ | — | Paid |

**Per-capability split:** you can use different providers for search and extract independently — for example SearXNG (free) for search and Firecrawl for extract. See [Per-capability configuration](#per-capability-configuration) below.

:::tip Nous Subscribers
If you have a paid [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com) subscription, web search and extract are available through the **[Tool Gateway](tool-gateway.md)** via managed Firecrawl — no API key needed. Run `hermes tools` to enable it.

## Setup

### Quick setup via `hermes tools`

Run `hermes tools`, navigate to **Web Search & Extract**, and pick a provider. The wizard prompts for the required URL or API key and writes it to your config.

```bash
hermes tools
```

---

### Firecrawl (default)

Full-featured search, extract, and crawl. Recommended for most users.

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-your-key-here
```

Get a key at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev). The free tier includes 500 credits/month.

**Self-hosted Firecrawl:** Point at your own instance instead of the cloud API:

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
FIRECRAWL_API_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

When `FIRECRAWL_API_URL` is set, the API key is optional (disable server auth with `USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false`).

---

### SearXNG (free, self-hosted)

SearXNG is a privacy-respecting, open-source metasearch engine that aggregates results from 70+ search engines. **No API key required** — just point Hermes at a running SearXNG instance.

SearXNG is **search-only** — `web_extract` (including its crawl modes) requires a separate extract provider.

#### Option A — Self-host with Docker (recommended)

This gives you a private instance with no rate limits.

**1. Create a working directory:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/searxng/searxng
cd ~/searxng
```

**2. Write a `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
# ~/searxng/docker-compose.yml
services:
  searxng:
    image: searxng/searxng:latest
    container_name: searxng
    ports:
      - "8888:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./searxng:/etc/searxng:rw
    environment:
      - SEARXNG_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888/
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**3. Start the container:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**4. Enable the JSON API format:**

SearXNG ships with JSON output disabled by default. Copy the generated config and enable it:

```bash
# Copy the auto-generated config out of the container
docker cp searxng:/etc/searxng/settings.yml ~/searxng/searxng/settings.yml
```

Open `~/searxng/searxng/settings.yml` and find the `formats` block (around line 84):

```yaml
# Before (default — JSON disabled):
formats:
  - html

# After (enable JSON for Hermes):
formats:
  - html
  - json
```

**5. Restart to apply:**

```bash
docker cp ~/searxng/searxng/settings.yml searxng:/etc/searxng/settings.yml
docker restart searxng
```

**6. Verify it works:**

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8888/search?q=test&format=json" | python3 -c \
  "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f'{len(d[\"results\"])} results')"
```

You should see something like `10 results`. If you get a `403 Forbidden`, JSON format is still disabled — recheck step 4.

**7. Configure Hermes:**

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
SEARXNG_URL=http://localhost:8888
```

Then select SearXNG as the search backend in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
web:
  search_backend: "searxng"
```

Or set via `hermes tools` → Web Search & Extract → SearXNG.

---

#### Option B — Use a public instance

Public SearXNG instances are listed at [searx.space](https://searx.space/). Filter by instances that have **JSON format enabled** (shown in the table).

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
SEARXNG_URL=https://searx.example.com
```

:::caution Public instances
Public instances have rate limits, variable uptime, and may disable JSON format at any time. For production use, self-hosting is strongly recommended.
:::

---

#### Pair SearXNG with an extract provider

SearXNG handles search; you need a separate provider for `web_extract` (including any deep-crawl modes). Use the per-capability keys:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
web:
  search_backend: "searxng"
  extract_backend: "firecrawl"   # or tavily, exa, parallel
```

With this config, Hermes uses SearXNG for all search queries and Firecrawl for URL extraction — combining free search with high-quality extraction.

---

### Tavily

AI-optimised search, extract, and crawl with a generous free tier.

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-your-key-here
```

Get a key at [app.tavily.com](https://app.tavily.com/home). The free tier includes 1 000 searches/month.

---

### Exa

Neural search with semantic understanding. Good for research and finding conceptually related content.

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
EXA_API_KEY=your-exa-key-here
```

Get a key at [exa.ai](https://exa.ai). The free tier includes 1 000 searches/month.

---

### Parallel

AI-native search and extraction with deep research capabilities.

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
PARALLEL_API_KEY=your-parallel-key-here
```

Get access at [parallel.ai](https://parallel.ai).

---

## Configuration

### Single backend

Set one provider for all web capabilities:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
web:
  backend: "searxng"   # firecrawl | searxng | tavily | exa | parallel
```

### Per-capability configuration

Use different providers for search vs extract. This lets you combine free search (SearXNG) with a paid extract provider, or vice versa:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
web:
  search_backend: "searxng"     # used by web_search
  extract_backend: "firecrawl"  # used by web_extract (and its deep-crawl modes)
```

When per-capability keys are empty, both fall through to `web.backend`. When `web.backend` is also empty, the backend is auto-detected from whichever API key/URL is present.

**Priority order (per capability):**
1. `web.search_backend` / `web.extract_backend` (explicit per-capability)
2. `web.backend` (shared fallback)
3. Auto-detect from environment variables

### Auto-detection

If no backend is explicitly configured, Hermes picks the first available one based on which credentials are set:

| Credential present | Auto-selected backend |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or `FIRECRAWL_API_URL` | firecrawl |
| `PARALLEL_API_KEY` | parallel |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | tavily |
| `EXA_API_KEY` | exa |
| `SEARXNG_URL` | searxng |

---

## Verify your setup

Run `hermes setup` to see which web backend is detected:

```
✅ Web Search & Extract (searxng)
```

Or check via the CLI:

```bash
# Activate the venv and run the web tools module directly
source ~/.hermes/hermes-agent/.venv/bin/activate
python -m tools.web_tools
```

This prints the active backend and its status:

```
✅ Web backend: searxng
   Using SearXNG (search only): http://localhost:8888
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `web_search` returns `{"success": false}`

- Check `SEARXNG_URL` is reachable: `curl -s "http://localhost:8888/search?q=test&format=json"`
- If you get HTTP 403, JSON format is disabled — add `json` to the `formats` list in `settings.yml` and restart
- If you get a connection error, the container may not be running: `docker ps | grep searxng`

### `web_extract` says "search-only backend"

SearXNG cannot extract URL content. Set `web.extract_backend` to a provider that supports extraction:

```yaml
web:
  search_backend: "searxng"
  extract_backend: "firecrawl"  # or tavily / exa / parallel
```

### SearXNG returns 0 results

Some public instances disable certain search engines or categories. Try:
- A different query
- A different public instance from [searx.space](https://searx.space/)
- Self-hosting your own instance for reliable results

### Rate limited on a public instance

Switch to a self-hosted instance (see [Option A](#option-a--self-host-with-docker-recommended) above). With Docker, your own instance has no rate limits.

## Optional skill: `searxng-search`

For agents that need to use SearXNG via `curl` directly (e.g. as a fallback when the web toolset isn't available), install the `searxng-search` optional skill:

```bash
hermes skills install official/research/searxng-search
```

This adds a skill that teaches the agent how to:
- Call the SearXNG JSON API via `curl` or Python
- Filter by category (`general`, `news`, `science`, etc.)
- Handle pagination and error cases
- Fall back gracefully when SearXNG is unreachable
