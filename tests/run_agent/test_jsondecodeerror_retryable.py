"""Regression guard for #14782: json.JSONDecodeError must not be classified
as a local validation error by the main agent loop.

`json.JSONDecodeError` inherits from `ValueError`. The agent loop's
non-retryable classifier at run_agent.py treats `ValueError` / `TypeError`
as local programming bugs and skips retry. Without an explicit carve-out,
a transient provider hiccup (malformed response body, truncated stream,
routing-layer corruption) that surfaces as a JSONDecodeError would bypass
the retry path and fail the turn immediately.

This test mirrors the exact predicate shape used in run_agent.py so that
any future refactor of that predicate must preserve the invariant:

    JSONDecodeError     → NOT local validation error (retryable)
    UnicodeEncodeError  → NOT local validation error (surrogate path)
    bare ValueError     → IS local validation error (programming bug)
    bare TypeError      → IS local validation error (programming bug)
